To resolve the issue, there are several approaches:

**1. Adjust Selector Specificity:** Rethink your selectors to avoid the conflict. For example, if possible, use more general class names instead of relying on very specific IDs, like changing `#myElement .child` to another more appropriate selector. 

**2. Use !important (With Caution):** As a last resort, the `!important` flag can override specificity but this approach should be used sparingly as it compromises CSS's natural cascading behavior and makes maintenance difficult.

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue !important;
}

#myElement .child {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

#myElement {
    width: 500px;
}

.child {
  height: 100px;
}
```

The `bugSolution.css` illustrates the `!important` approach, although it is often advised to reconsider the CSS structure instead. The best solution frequently involves revising selectors to align with the intended style hierarchy and avoid unnecessary specificity conflicts.
