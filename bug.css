The following CSS code snippet suffers from a subtle but critical error related to specificity and cascading.  The `.container` class styles are unexpectedly overridden by the more specific `#myElement .child` selector:

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

#myElement .child {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

#myElement {
    width: 500px;
}

.child {
  height: 100px;
}
```

In this case, even though `.container` appears earlier,  `#myElement .child` is more specific because it uses an ID selector (#myElement) in addition to a class selector (.child). This makes the background-color: lightcoral style applied to any `.child` element within an element with ID `myElement`, overriding the `background-color: lightblue`.
